# Google Hash Code 2019

All the boilerplate to test your wonderful solution, still written on paper with a pencil :)

## How to use
You need NodeJS installed, please refer to [this](https://nodejs.org/it/download/) guide to install it.

Fork the project and clone it locally on your computer.

From a terminal, just type:
```bash
$ node index.js
```

This will create two files for each data set :
- datasetname_out.txt: the file to submit on the judge system
- datasetname_debug.txt: similar to the previous, but with more debug information

While running, the javascript file will print on console the score for each data set and the total score.

Now... happy coding :)
